Raavi AdithyaKrishna is my name. and I study applied computer sciences at our college as an international student.

              We use the SAP UI5 front end, which includes css, html, java, and java coding languages, and we use API to integrate the front end and backend. I have past industry expertise of three years in SAP ABAP backend and HanaDB.

       I'm eager to participate in the sprint talks and weekly reviews and interested in learning more about our project. wishing the project the best chance of success.
